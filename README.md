go-title-length-alert
=====================

alerts user in the post edit page when the post title length exceeds some configured character count

This plugin watches the length of the post title and warns the user via
the title length message under the title text field when the text exceeds
some predefined length. We have two thresholds: alert_threshold and
high_alert_threshold, each of which can be configured to change the title
length count to a different color to warn the writer.
